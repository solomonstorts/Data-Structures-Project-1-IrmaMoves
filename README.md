# Data-Structures-Project-1-IrmaMoves
The first programming assignment for the Data Structures class at Florida Polytechnic University.

# Overview
**From the IrmaMoves.pdf file provided:**
"In this programming assignment, you will implement an interpreter for algebraic notation for recording and describing the hurricane Irma moves. In order to finish this program, you will need to learn a bit about how hurricane Irma can move on the map board, as well as how those moves are denoted with algebraic notation.

By completing this assignment, you will gain experience manipulating strings, 2D arrays, structs, and struct pointers in C. You will also gain experience working with dynamic memory allocation and squashing memory leaks. On the software engineering side of things, you will learn to construct programs that use multiple source files and custom header (.h) files. This assignment will also help you hone your ability to read technical specifications and implement a reasonably lengthy, non-trivial project with interconnected pieces."
